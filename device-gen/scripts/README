# Generate microfluidic geometry

Set of scripts to generate device geometries as Signed Distance Function in *.dat format
To clean the dependencies and then build them:
```
./cleanall.sh
./makeall.sh
```

## Parabolic funnels
Geometry mimicing the microfluidic device by McFaul et al [Cell separation based on size and deformability using microfluidic funnel ratchets](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22517056)
To generate a this geometry with 10 rows and 20 columns run:
```
./run-parab.py -r 10 -c 20
```

## Later displacement device
Geometry reproducing CTC-iChip1 module by Karabacak et al [Microfluidic, marker-free isolation of circulating tumor cells from blood samples](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v9/n3/full/nprot.2014.044.html)

To build geometry with 13 columns and 59 rows:
```
./run-egg.py -r 59 -c 13
```
Note, the python script requre modifications if you want to change resolution, wall width and other parameters
