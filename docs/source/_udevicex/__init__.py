            Args:
                nranks:
                    number of MPI simulation tasks per axis: x,y,z. If postprocess is enabled, the same number of the postprocess tasks will be running
                domain:
                    size of the simulation domain in x,y,z. Periodic boundary conditions are applied at the domain boundaries.
                    The domain will be split in equal chunks between the MPI ranks.
                    The largest chunk size that a single MPI rank can have depends on the total number of particles,
                    handlers and hardware, and is typically about :math:`120^3 - 200^3`.
                log_filename:
                    prefix of the log files that will be created. 
                    Logging is implemented in the form of one file per MPI rank, so in the simulation folder NP files with names log_00000.log, log_00001.log, ... will be created, where NP is the total number of MPI ranks. 
                    Each MPI task (including postprocess) writes messages about itself into his own log file, and the combined log may be created by merging all the individual ones and sorting with respect to time.
                    If this parameter is set to 'stdout' or 'stderr' standard output or standard error streams will be used instead of the file, however, there is no guarantee that messages from different ranks are synchronized
                debug_level:
                    Debug level varies from 1 to 8:
                    
                       #. only report fatal errors
                       #. report serious errors
                       #. report warnings (this is the default level)
                       #. report not critical information
                       #. report some debug information
                       #. report more debug
                       #. report all the debug
                       #. force flushing to the file after each message
                    
                    Debug levels above 4 or 5 may significanlty increase the runtime, they are only recommended to debug errors.
                    Flushing increases the runtime yet more, but it is required in order not to lose any messages in case of abnormal program abort.
                checkpoint_every:
                    save state of the simulation components (particle vectors and handlers like integrators, plugins, etc.)
                restart_folder:
                    folder where the checkpoint files will reside
                cuda_aware_mpi: enable CUDA Aware MPI (GPU RDMA). As of now it may crash, or may yield slower execution.
