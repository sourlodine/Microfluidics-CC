Object belonging checkers
#########################


Object belonging checkers serve two purpooses.
Firstly, they are used to split a particle vector into two disjointed parts (probably forming a new Particle Vector):
the particles that are *inside* any object of the given Object Vector and the particles that are *outside*.
Secondly, they are used to maintain the mentioned *inside*-*outside* property of the particles in the resulting Particle Vectors.
