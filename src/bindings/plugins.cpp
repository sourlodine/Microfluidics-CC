        This plugin will add force on all the particles that are nearby a specified wall. The motivation of this plugin is as follows.
        The particles of regular PVs are prevented from penetrating into the walls by Wall Bouncers.
        However, using Wall Bouncers with Object Vectors may be undesirable (e.g. in case of a very viscous membrane) or impossible (in case of rigid objects).
        In these cases one can use either strong repulsive potential between the object and the wall particle or alternatively this plugin.
        The advantage of the SDF-based repulsion is that small penetrations won't break the simulation.
        
        The force expression looks as follows:
        
        .. math::
        
            \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{\nabla}_{sdf} \cdot \begin{cases}

        Any such channel may be used in this plug-in, however, user must explicitely specify the type of values that the channel holds.
