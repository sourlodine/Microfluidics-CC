        Base class for bouncing particles off the objects
        
        Bouncers prevent liquid particles crossing boundaries of objects (maintaining no-through boundary conditions).
        The idea of the bouncers is to move the particles that crossed the object boundary after integration step back to the correct side.
        Particles are moved such that they appear very close (about :math:`10^{-4}` units away from the boundary).
        Assuming that the objects never come too close to each other or the walls,
        that approach ensures that recovered particles will not penetrate into a different object or wall.
        In practice maintaining separation of at least :math:`10^{-3}` units between walls and objects is sufficient.
        Note that particle velocities are also altered, which means that objects experience extra force from the collisions.
        The force from a collision is applied at the beginning of the following time-step.

            This bouncer will use the triangular mesh associated with objects to detect boundary crossings.
