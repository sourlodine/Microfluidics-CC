/**
 * Engine implementing MPI exchange logic.
 *
 * The pipeline is as follows:
 * - base method init() sets up the communication:
 *   - calls base method postRecvSize() that issues MPI_Irecv() calls
 *     for sizes of data that has to be received
 *   - calls exchanger method prepareData() that fills the corresponding
 *     ExchangeHelper buffers with the data to exchange
 * - base method finalize() runs the communication (it could
 *   be split into send/recv pair, maybe this will be done later):
 *   - calls base method send() that sends the data from ExchangeHelper
 *     buffers to the relevant MPI processes
 *   - calls base method recv() that blocks until the sizes of the
 *     data and data themselves are received and stored in the ExchangeHelper
 *   - calls exchanger combineAndUploadData() that takes care
 *     of storing data from the ExchangeHelper to where is has to be
